      This is good for future potential of having swap support
      Make model for chains to be able to use them more broadly?
  ☐ Asset Portfolio @created(22-09-23 00:21)
    Need to split up assets between platforms (ex. FTM Address, FTX, Binance)
    The split is needed for future automation and just to keep it "clean"?
    Maybe start by just tagging them manually?
